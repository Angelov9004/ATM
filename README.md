Java console program for implementing a bank ATM interface. Upon logging in with a 
username and pin, a user should be able to make deposits, withdrawals, and 
transfers between accounts. The user should also be able to list the 
transactions for each account, so this program can be somewhat of a blend 
between the functionality of an ATM and that of an online banking system.
